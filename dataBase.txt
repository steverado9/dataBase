accesss to database users.
DBSM is like a piece of software that allows us to communicate with the database.
and it allows us to update, delete, insert, lookup Whatever inside the software.
 Types of DBMS
They are both represented well by PostgreSQL, MONGODB.
1)Relational DataBase: This consist of two or more tables with columns and rows.
The relation between tables and field is called schema.
All relational dataBase use something called SQL.
with SQL, we are able to communicate with the backend.
2)Non relational dataBase(NoSQL)
A non relational dataBase or a MONGODB lets you build an application without having to define the schema first.
with NoSQL we can just efine the schema as we go.
MONGODB is document oriented i.e it stores information as documents.
MONGODB query language helps communicate with the backend
